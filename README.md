This repository contains the Matlab program for the Characteristic Point Method (CPM), a method for automatic separation of hydrograph and extraction of flood events from long-term time series, reported in Mei & Anagnostou (2015, A Hydrograph Separation Method Based on Information from Rainfall and Runoff Records). A user manual of the program and demonstration of implementation are also provided.
