This repository contains the Matlab program for the Characteristic Point Method (CPM), a method for automatic separation of hydrograph and extraction of flood events from long-term time series, reported in Mei & Anagnostou (2015, A Hydrograph Separation Method Based on Information from Rainfall and Runoff Records). A user manual of the program and demonstration of implementation are also provided.

Details of files in repository:
1. The "Demo_data.mat" contains inputs of the CPM program and the "Results.mat" contains results produced by the program.
2. The "Demo.m" file is an example of how to run the CPM program.
3. The "CPM.m", "CPM_FE.m", "CPM_peak.m", "CPM_RE.m" and "FRCK.m" are components of the CPM program.
4. The "CPM User Manual_MM.DD.YYYY.pdf" is the user manual of the program.
5. Please see the user manual for instructions on how to set up the CPM program. The user manual also contains the instructions for
   running the Demo code.
6. The program may subject to update ocassionally. Please check for the new version on our website.
